# AI-Based Supply Chain Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies AI and Machine Learning to enhance supply chain sales forecasting. Traditional forecasting methods, such as moving averages, often struggle with dynamic market conditions, leading to overstocking or understocking issues. Our approach leverages AI models to provide more accurate and adaptive predictions.

# 🚀 Features
- AI-Driven Sales Forecasting: Uses Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ARIMA models.
- Data Preprocessing & Visualization: Handles missing data, outliers, and correlation analysis.
- Model Performance Comparison: Uses MAE, R², RMSE for evaluation.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV optimization for improved accuracy.
- Time Series Analysis: Implements ARIMA and SARIMA for seasonal trends.

# 📊 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Removing null values, handling duplicates.
2. Data Visualization: Sales distribution, correlation heatmaps.
3. Model Training:
   - Random Forest for general predictions.
   - Gradient Boosting for complex relationships.
   - ARIMA/SARIMA for time series forecasting.
4. Evaluation: MAE, R² Score, RMSE.
5. Hyperparameter Optimization: GridSearchCV tuning for improved results.

# 📌 Results
- Achieved **89% accuracy** with Random Forest.
- Improved accuracy by **1%** after hyperparameter tuning.
